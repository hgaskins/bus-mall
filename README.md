purpose
------------

The purpose of this project is to simulate market research for a "Bus Mall" (a play on SkyMall).

For this we will cycle through three side by side images randomly for users to vote on which of the three product images they like best. This cycle through will happen 16 times.

Once that 16th vote happens two buttons will then appear:
- one for showing the results
- another for 8 additional votes

When the user is finished with either the first 16 votes or the subsequent 8 votes, the results will appear using a visualization of the data.

user stories
------------

- As a user I want to be able choose which product I like best in a fun, user-friendly way.
- As a market researcher I want to be able to see which products users want to buy in an organized and visual way.
- As a developer I want to organize code to be readable and functional
