            Welcome to BusMall. This is an interative project I created to display a few software development techniques I have taught myself along the way. The premise of the project is that BusMall (unlike SkyMall) is wanting to narrow down their products to only the best sellers. The user clicks to the market research page and clicks on their favorite products. The user gets 16 clicks, and is prompted to either vote more or see the results of the products they liked best in a chart display for number of clicks, and percentage of clicks based on image showen numbers.
            <br>
            <br>I have used Skeleton for a base css with my own styles to fit the look of the faux company. Charts.js, local storage techniques, event listeners, and basic javascript software development.
            <br>
            <br> All images were taken from  <a class="inline-link" href="https://www.everlane.com/">Everlane.</a> I also took a host of inspiration from the site design as well. I am a huge fan of the aesthetics of the site and their clothing. All style on this project is a tip of the hat to one of my favorite companies.
